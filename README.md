#  Cocktails
Take home assignment for Schibsted

I chose to use MVC architecture for the UIKit part and MVVM architecture for the SwiftUI part.
I prefer MVVM but have not used it with UIKit before. If I were to use MVVM with UIKit I would probably leverage the Combine framework.

The network layer is one I built for a project I'm currently working on. I used it both to show you I can make a more complex, abstracted network layer and to save time.

My strategy was to start with the basic functionality - make sure I could load the cocktails, make the list screen and detail views. After that I added to and iterated on the code with the time I had left of the estimated 4 hours.
